                While independently ranked among the 25 Top Children's Charities in the United States, ICAF's tenous
                financial position reflects the lack of
                understanding of business, philanthropic, and political Leaders of the critical importance of
                creativity and empathy, and the urgency to develop these vital human traits for a prosperous and
                peaceful future.

            <div class="section-titles">5% Overhead</div>
            <div class="sections">
                Because a network of volunteers nationwide and worldwide help ICAF conduct its programs and organize its
                festivals and exhibitions, ICAF overhead expenses are traditionally less than 5%.
                Hence, nearly all charitable contributions directly fund educational programs and events.
            </div>

            <div class="section-titles">Zero Service Revenue</div>
            <div class="sections">
                Unconventionally, ICAF's programs are free of charge, its magazine is free of commercial advertisements,
                and its World Children's Festival is free and open to the public. ICAF does not earn any revenue from
                the services it provides, which makes the charity entirely dependent
                on donations and yet ICAF does not spend any money on fundraising.
            </div>

            <div class="section-titles">Integrity</div>
            <div class="sections">
                ICAF has earned a reputation for financial integrity and efficiency. ICAF has earned the 2022 GuideStar
                Platinum Transparency ranking. ICAF takes stewardship seriously and
                works to maximize the value of every contribution received.
