                Creativity sparks inventions, shifts paradigms, and brings disruptive innovations. Creativity is and
                has always been a survival skill. For those underprivileged, creativity boosts their confidence to
                blaze new trails that can disrupt the vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty. Unfortunately,
                human creative development faces a roadblock—the "4th-grade slump" in children's creativity
                discovered by E. Paul Torrance, the father of modern creativity. This slump grows into a crisis when
                standardized testing promotes rote learning and when students engage less in deep learning or
                seek experiences that inspire creativity because a plethora of information and entertainment is
                readily available online.
                <br>
                <br>
                ICAF's school art program (the Arts Olympiad) empowers students to overcome the "4th-grade
                slump." The Arts Olympiad's structured lesson plans inspire students to embrace the
                Artist-Athlete Ideal of the creative mind and healthy body (<i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>). This
                paradigm awakens the dormant "inner artist" or the slumbering "inner athlete," liberating the
                natural tendency toward creativity and good health. Students realize that mind and body reflect
                each other because one's state of mind can have an epigenetic effect. The revised self-image
                solidifies when students depict themselves as artist-athletes in their artwork. As artist-athletes
                grow in number, the school transforms into a more integrated, creative, healthy community.

            <div class="section-quote">
                <p>"Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves to know what another person sees."</p>

            <div class="section">
                The word "empathy" is derived from einfühlung (literally "feeling into" something), which can
                describe what a beholder feels when facing a painting. Empathy is a vicarious, embodied
                identification and conscious involvement with another and has profound implications when the
                other is not an artist but is the enemy. Empathy is and has been Homo sapiens' survival skill. It
                fosters conflict resolution and stimulates collaborative innovation. It makes democracy workable
                and capitalism socially responsible. When empathy is absent, knowledge cannot evolve into
                wisdom. And awareness does not translate into action for social justice and poverty eradication or
                against climate change, the next big war, and pandemics.
                <br>
                <br>
                Of the nearly 55 million children enrolled in PK 12 schools in the U.S., about 10% attend private
                schools, and nearly 80% of them religious schools. According to the National Center for Education
                Statistics, enrollment in conservative Christian, Jewish, and Islamic schools is increasing. Religious
                education can develop fellow feelings or "parochial" empathy among co-religionists. The late
                University of Pennsylvania neuroscientist Emile Bruneau found that the stronger the parochial
                empathy, the deeper the fear of or the hatred for outsiders and outgroups.
                <br>
                <br>
                Public and private school students and those attending religious schools or are homeschooled
                come together at the World Children's Festival (WCF) in Washington, DC, every four years. ICAF's
                intervention at the WCF allows these young participants to co-imagine and co-create so they
                build trust and develop mutual empathy. The WCF's transformative experience boosts their self-
                confidence and self-worth as creators of the future so they can overcome adverse childhood
                experiences (ACEs) that might turn victims into perpetrators. Empathy training and social-
                emotional learning empower children to disrupt the transgenerational transmission of trauma,
                hatred, and retribution—so they fight not for their tribe's history but for "a more perfect union." By
                infusing creativity with empathy, the WCF inspires children to become <i>creative-empaths</i>.

                Creativity is a salient human attribute, but it is morally neutral. Malevolent creativity abounds with
                intentionality to harm other people or society as a whole. What makes creativity positive to
                advance civilization and humanity? Empathy. In reality, creativity and empathy are like two hands
                that complement and enrich each other. Creativity clears the pathway to reach its pinnacle, which
                is empathy. Empathy imbues creativity with the diversity of human experiences for global
                competency and universality. A creative mind and an empathic heart make a person wholesome.
                Only <i>creative-empaths</i> can create a more peaceful, sustainable, and prosperous future.

                including social and emotional development, improvements in school engagement, as well as vital
                civic and social participation." Art programs are effective and also the least-cost interventions.

                ICAF employs the arts as a dynamic activity for students' creative and empathic development. Art
                grows a child's imagination, and collaborative mural-making can become a building block for self-
                discovery and collaborative innovation. The arts can change a person. ICAF leverages the power of
                the arts for students to enhance their self-identity, first as artist-athletes through the Arts
                Olympiad, then as <i>creative-empaths</i> at the WCF.
