                                    Books and movies tell stories. Parents tell stories, too. But 
do shoes tell stories? Thomas Halbur says yes! At this year’s 
World Children’s Festival (WCF), Thomas led a shoe design 
workshop.
 
“You can take a sneaker at face value—the pieces and parts 
put together to make just a shoe—or you can incorporate art 
into the shoe, making it a medium to share your own story,” 
says Thomas. “Similarly, you can take a person at face value, 
or you can take a closer look, making an effort to learn their 
story.” Art is the great medium for expressing creativity and 
diversity,  and for bringing  people together by transcending 
common communication barriers. 
Thomas brought his idea to life in a big white tent at the World 
Children’s  Festival, helping  kids from  across the US and 
beyond, design their own unique shoes. With stencils, markers, 
and paper, they began to create. Bright colors and bright minds 
came together to tell stories of journeys that kids will walk with 
hope, creativity, and empathy.
Thomas’s own story led him on a path to the WCF. Born in 
Masan, South Korea, he was adopted by a family in the United 
States when he was three months old.
As a child he attended George Catlin Elementary School, an 
arts magnet school in Nebraska named for the American artist 
known for his depiction of Native Americans in the western 
US in the early 1800s. In elementary  school, Thomas was 
given space to explore different kinds of art. He learned about 
Georgia O’Keeffe and Salvador Dalí. He was exposed to art 
of the Mayans and Incas. He took field trips to the local art 
museum. Most importantly, his education was hands-on with 
room to be creative. He gained confidence realizing there can 
sometimes be more than one correct answer. 
His childhood also included experiences to help others. While 
spending time at shelters for women and children, or missions 
to aid the homeless, he was exposed to others who had less 
than he did. “I played with children there and didn’t see them as 
kids in bad situations. We were just all kids.” His parents offered 
many opportunities for Thomas and his brother to contribute to 
the lives of others, planting seeds of empathy early on. Thomas 
has spent the last four and a half years serving his country as 
a member of the US Navy.
As the years went by, Thomas decided to learn more about 
his heritage. He began to do some research on the country 
of his birth, Korea, and discovered Dancheong, the traditional 
art of Korea. Dancheong is the ancient practice of painting 
geometric patterns, often on Buddhist temples. Aside from its 
exquisite beauty, it also served the purpose of preserving wood. 
Dancheong is a compilation of geometric patterns using a color 
palette of just five colors. The five colors represent the five 
elements and the principle of yin and yang.
One day, Thomas learned of a shoe design contest. Participants 
were asked to design a shoe that highlighted something about 
their own geographic location or their heritage. Thomas entered 
the contest using designs from his Korean heritage. Although, 
he didn’t win, he received considerable positive feedback. He 
began to realize that these shoes told a story. Their artful design 
is an introduction to his culture and an expression of self. The 
attention to detail, by both the creator and the observer of the 
shoe, is a similitude of the attention to detail we can offer one 
another. Art preserves culture and conveys people’s unique 
identities. Combining  art  and culture opens a dialogue  and  
generates empathy.
Thomas will continue his shoe design project with a plan to give 
back. He is working with a shoemaker who will take his original 
design and produce ten pairs of sneakers. The sneakers will be 
auctioned with half the proceeds donated to ICAF and the other 
half donated to the art museum of his childhood hometown.
